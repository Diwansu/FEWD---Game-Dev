Tumble Word is a game where words will be falling from the screen and player have to type the correct words without unnecessary spaces.
If player typed the mistake word then game will be over and  final score will be shown to the player. 

I I got inspiration from https://github.com/toyamarodrigo/falling-words-game/tree/master this github. 
 However I made some changes to the logic and modified the code as per my need with full understanding of the code.
 I solely declare that I did not do 100% copy of the code.

 I take few images from google. Few are from Freepik and unsplash.
 I took the sound effect from pixabay.
